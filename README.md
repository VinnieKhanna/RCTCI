Recracking the Coding Interview: CS 4650 Natural Language Processing

## Setup and Installation
Our code that generated the results is all in the .ipynb file called Recracking the Coding Interview. The code runs best on Google Colab using a GPU. First, create a folder called 'CS4650' in your Google Drive. Then copy the contents of the data folder (but NOT the data folder itself) into your CS4650 folder in your Google Drive. Open up Recracking the Coding Interview in Colab. It is now ready to run!

## Running the Code
### TF-IDF + SMOTE + Logistic Regression with ELI5 Weights on Runtime, Difficulty, and Topics
Run the first 5 cells of the notebook (up to and including the cell that '%ls'). Then, jump to 'Runtime Model with Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, SMOTE' in the table of contents and run the 3 cells inside. Repeat for 'Difficulty Model with Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, SMOTE' and 'Difficulty Model with Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, SMOTE'.

### BERT for Sequence Classification
Run the first 5 cells of the notebook (up to and including the cell that '%ls'). Then, jump to 'BertforSequenceClassification' in the table of contents. 'Runtime', 'Difficulty', and 'Topics' are each present as sections under 'BertforSequenceClassification'. Run the cells in each section to see the results.
